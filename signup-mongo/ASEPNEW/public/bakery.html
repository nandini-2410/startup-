      Starting a bakery can be both creative and profitable. You can begin by offering freshly baked items like cakes, pastries, and cookies either from home or a small shop. Success depends on quality, hygiene, and local marketing. With the rise of online ordering and celebration trends, bakery businesses have huge potential.
      A bakery can be established as a retail business from a storefront location selling baked goods to consumers, or a bakery can be established as a wholesale business selling baked goods to food retailers and institutions. Additionally, many bakeries will operate both as a retail and wholesale business to increase the size of their potential market as well as revenues and profits. Establishing a bakery is a very straightforward process with one exception–the best bakers possess bakers trade papers–so be prepared to hire a qualified baker, or take the time necessary to become one. The profit potential is good for a bakery, especially if the business focuses on both retail and wholesales baked goods sales.
