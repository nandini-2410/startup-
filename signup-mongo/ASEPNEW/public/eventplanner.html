      An Event Planner startup involves organizing, coordinating, and managing events such as weddings, corporate functions, product launches, birthdays, cultural programs, and festivals. With the demand for seamless, customized, and creative experiences rising, event planners are more essential than ever.

      Steps to start:
      <ul>
        <li>Define your niche (weddings, corporate, social events, etc.)</li>
        <li>Build a vendor network (caterers, decorators, venues, artists, DJs)</li>
        <li>Create packages for different event types and budgets</li>
        <li>Develop an impressive online portfolio with past event photos</li>
      </ul>

      Services may include:
      <ul>
        <li>Budget planning and vendor coordination</li>
        <li>Venue selection, theme planning, and décor setup</li>
        <li>Logistics and scheduling</li>
        <li>On-site event management and troubleshooting</li>
      </ul>

      Success relies on creativity, organization, communication skills, and attention to detail. Social media platforms like Instagram and Pinterest help you showcase your work visually and attract clients.

      This startup is scalable — you can begin with small events and grow into high-budget celebrations or even corporate exhibitions and expos. Good reviews and referrals are key to long-term growth.
