      Educational Content Creation involves producing learning materials such as videos, infographics, quizzes, notes, animations, or interactive lessons. This startup supports schools, ed-tech platforms, and self-learners with engaging digital content aligned with educational goals.

      You can start by:
      <ul>
        <li>Identifying subjects, boards, or skills in demand (e.g., coding, math, science)</li>
        <li>Creating video lessons, notes, and interactive slides using tools like Canva, OBS, and PowerPoint</li>
        <li>Collaborating with educators or voice-over artists for professional quality</li>
        <li>Publishing on platforms like YouTube, Udemy, or your own LMS</li>
      </ul>

      This business can be run solo or as a team of writers, animators, and voice artists. You can offer your content to coaching institutes or monetize through course sales and subscriptions.

      With the boom in e-learning, educational content creators are in demand for K–12, competitive exams, and professional skills. Quality and creativity are the keys to standing out in this fast-growing space.
