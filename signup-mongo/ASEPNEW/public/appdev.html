      App Development is a high-potential startup idea where you build educational apps for students, teachers, or institutions. These apps may include features like interactive quizzes, live classes, homework tracking, or e-learning content delivery.

      You can begin by:
      <ul>
        <li>Identifying a specific need or gap in the education system (e.g., exam prep, doubt-solving, attendance tracking)</li>
        <li>Creating mockups and wireframes using Figma or Adobe XD</li>
        <li>Using technologies like Flutter, React Native, or Android Studio to build the app</li>
        <li>Offering MVP versions for feedback before full launch</li>
      </ul>

      Monetization options include freemium models, subscription-based learning, school partnerships, or in-app purchases. Collaborating with educators and UI/UX designers ensures quality content and intuitive experience.

      With rising mobile learning adoption, well-designed educational apps have a wide market. Focus on solving real problems, data privacy, and user engagement to succeed in this startup.
