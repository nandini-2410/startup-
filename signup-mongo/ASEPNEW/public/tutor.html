    <div class="description">
      Starting a private tutoring business is one of the most accessible educational startups. It requires minimal investment and offers flexible working hours. Tutors can specialize in subjects like math, science, languages, or competitive exam preparation based on their expertise.

      You can offer:
      <ul>
        <li>In-person or online one-on-one tutoring</li>
        <li>Group sessions or weekend crash courses</li>
        <li>Recorded lessons and worksheets</li>
      </ul>

      Initial costs may include basic teaching supplies, whiteboards, internet, and tools like Zoom, Google Meet, or Skype. You may also invest in a website or social media marketing.

      Targeting school and college students, and even professionals for skill development, tutoring provides high demand and good income potential. As reputation grows, tutors can expand into coaching centers or launch digital courses.
