      A Wedding Consultant startup focuses on helping couples plan their dream wedding stress-free. From budget planning to vendor coordination, wedding consultants ensure every detail is managed professionally and on time.

      Key services include:
      <ul>
        <li>Venue selection and theme planning</li>
        <li>Coordination with caterers, decorators, photographers</li>
        <li>Timeline management and guest coordination</li>
        <li>Handling rituals, entertainment, and logistics</li>
      </ul>

      You can start small with local weddings, building a portfolio through personalized service. Networking with florists, makeup artists, and venues gives you a strong advantage. Software tools can be used for scheduling, reminders, and budget tracking.

      Market yourself via wedding expos, Instagram wedding reels, Google Business Profile, and word-of-mouth. The trust you build with clients will drive referrals and repeat business in families.

      Wedding planning is emotional and impactful — your role is not just logistics but creating memories. A reliable and creative consultant can grow into a full-fledged wedding planning agency.
