    <div class="description">
      A Handwriting Class startup focuses on helping students, especially kids, improve their penmanship through structured training. As digital learning grows, many parents still value the importance of neat handwriting for school exams and cognitive development.

      To start:
      <ul>
        <li>Rent or set up a small classroom space or operate from home</li>
        <li>Design a curriculum with different levels: basic strokes, cursive writing, speed writing, etc.</li>
        <li>Offer group classes, one-on-one coaching, or even online video lessons</li>
        <li>Use worksheets, tracing books, and feedback-based improvement techniques</li>
      </ul>

      You can also partner with schools or tuition centers to offer classes within their premises. Charging on a monthly or course-wise basis makes it affordable and scalable.

      Low investment, high demand among young learners, and the potential to expand into calligraphy or art-based handwriting classes make this a rewarding educational startup idea.
