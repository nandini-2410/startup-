    <div class="description">
      Home care services provide essential support to elderly, disabled, or recovering patients in the comfort of their homes. With an aging population and growing demand for personalized healthcare, this startup has high potential. Services typically include:
      <ul>
        <li>Assistance with daily activities (bathing, dressing, meals)</li>
        <li>Medical care (nursing, medication management)</li>
        <li>Physiotherapy and rehabilitation</li>
        <li>Companionship and mental wellness support</li>
      </ul>

      To get started, you’ll need trained caregivers, basic medical equipment, and proper legal registrations. You can operate through a small office or even virtually with a strong scheduling and dispatch system. Background checks, staff training, and insurance are crucial for trust and safety.

      Marketing can be done through hospitals, senior centers, social workers, and online platforms. You can also partner with doctors and clinics for client referrals. The business can expand by adding premium services like 24/7 care, physiotherapy, or on-call doctor visits.

      With empathy, reliability, and professional care, home care services not only generate income but also improve lives significantly.
